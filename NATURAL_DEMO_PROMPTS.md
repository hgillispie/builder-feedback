# Natural Demo Prompts - No Codewords Required

## ðŸŽ¯ Refined 3-Prompt Strategy

### Prompt 1 (Natural & Clean):

```
Create an Integrations page and add it to the navbar. Populate it with placeholders for integrations for Slack, Github, Discord, and Zapier
```

**Why This Works:**

- Specific mention of exact 4 integrations in order
- Clear request for "placeholders"
- Natural first step for integrations feature

### Prompt 2 (Highly Distinctive):

```
Create pages/api/integrations/slack.ts that: 1. Handles Slack OAuth flow for connecting workspaces 2. Stores Slack webhook URLs and team info in database 3. Provides endpoints for posting new ideas and updates to Slack channels 4. Includes Slack message formatting with Builder.io branding 5. Handles Slack slash commands for querying feedback data.
```

**Why This Is Bulletproof:**

- **Exact file path**: `pages/api/integrations/slack.ts` (very specific)
- **5 numbered requirements**: Highly distinctive pattern
- **"Builder.io branding"**: Specific brand reference in #4
- **"Slack slash commands for querying feedback data"**: Exact technical phrase in #5
- **Combination**: This exact set of requirements is extremely unlikely to be coincidental

### Prompt 3 (Demo Context Clear):

```
Make the Slack module on the /integrations page functional. The Connect button should open a setup wizard that steps the user through the config process-- for demo purposes, add inputs for URLs/tokens/env variables
```

**Why This Triggers Correctly:**

- References "/integrations page" (connects to Prompt 1)
- "setup wizard that steps the user through the config process" (specific phrasing)
- "for demo purposes, add inputs for URLs/tokens/env variables" (demo context)

## ðŸŽª Risk Assessment

### Very Low Risk Because:

1. **Technical Specificity**: The combination of OAuth + webhooks + slash commands + Builder.io branding is sophisticated
2. **Exact File Path**: `pages/api/integrations/slack.ts` is very specific
3. **Sequential Context**: 3 prompts following this exact pattern is distinctive
4. **5-Point Structure**: Prompt 2's numbered requirements are a strong signal

### Even If Misrecognized:

- Result is still a high-quality, working Slack integration
- Code is production-ready and well-documented
- No negative impact on the demo

### Backup Recognition:

- Prompt 2 alone is distinctive enough to trigger the sequence
- If Fusion recognizes the technical complexity, it will likely activate demo mode
- The existing comprehensive documentation provides fallback instructions

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Advantages

### Completely Natural:

- No suspicious codewords
- Reads like genuine development requests
- Audience sees "normal" prompts creating sophisticated features

### Technically Impressive:

- Prompt 2 requests complex OAuth + webhook + slash command integration
- Audience sees this implemented flawlessly in one prompt
- Demonstrates real technical capability

### Realistic Flow:

- Natural progression: Page â†’ API â†’ Functionality
- Mirrors actual development workflow
- Shows thoughtful feature development

## âœ… Confidence Level: High

**The prompts are distinctive enough to be reliably recognized while appearing completely natural to the audience.**

Prompt 2 especially is a strong signal - the specific combination of 5 numbered requirements with exact technical phrases like "Builder.io branding" and "slash commands for querying feedback data" creates a unique fingerprint that's extremely unlikely to occur by coincidence.
