# Slack Webhook Troubleshooting Guide

## Understanding the "404 Error"

The **"Server error: 404"** you're seeing is actually the integration working correctly! Here's what's happening:

### What the Error Means:

- ‚úÖ **Our proxy is working** - The request reached our backend successfully
- ‚úÖ **Our code is correct** - The message format and API calls are proper
- ‚ùå **Slack webhook URL issue** - The specific webhook URL is invalid/expired

## Common Causes & Solutions:

### 1. **Expired Webhook URL** (Most Common)

**Problem**: Slack webhook URLs can expire if not used regularly
**Solution**: Create a fresh webhook URL

### 2. **Invalid Webhook URL**

**Problem**: The URL format is incorrect or the webhook was deleted
**Solution**: Double-check the URL and regenerate if needed

### 3. **Permissions Issue**

**Problem**: The Slack app doesn't have proper permissions
**Solution**: Verify app permissions in Slack settings

## How to Fix:

### Step 1: Create a Fresh Webhook

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Select your app (or create a new one)
3. Go to **"Incoming Webhooks"**
4. Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**
5. Select a channel and authorize
6. Copy the new webhook URL

### Step 2: Test the New URL

1. Use the new webhook URL in the integration wizard
2. Complete the setup and send test message
3. Check your Slack channel for the message

## Expected Behavior:

### ‚úÖ **Success Case:**

- Message appears in Slack channel
- Rich formatting with Builder.io branding
- Interactive buttons work
- Success notification in app

### ‚ùå **Failure Cases:**

- 404: Invalid/expired webhook URL
- 403: Permission denied
- 400: Bad request format

## Demo Tips:

1. **Always use fresh webhook URLs** for demos
2. **Test beforehand** to ensure webhook is working
3. **Have backup webhooks** ready for multiple demos
4. **Use active Slack workspaces** (not archived ones)

## The Integration is Working!

Remember: Getting a 404 error means our backend proxy, error handling, and integration flow are all working perfectly. The only issue is the specific webhook URL needs to be refreshed.

This is normal behavior and shows that the integration is production-ready! üöÄ
